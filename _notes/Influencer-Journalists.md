Journalists always had influence in the public realm. Not only as storytellers and informers but also as cultural framers, commentators and at time king-makers. But in today‘s age we‘re observing a new kind of online media personality: the influencer-journalist.

The influencer-journalist is a person working on a social plattform to produce content that can be called journalistic, i.e. collecting, contextualising and presenting information with the goal of informing their audience. Though they might define themselves as either a journalist or an influencer/creator, their work or relationship to their audience might blur that border.

Still, there are some key differences in how the public perceives journalists and influencers. [Sandra Banjac](https://twitter.com/banjacsandra) and [Folker Hanusch](https://twitter.com/fhanusch) examined these boundries in a [study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1461444820963795), published in 2020. In short: 

- journalists are seen as detached and objective, while inlfuencers are subjective and emotional
- journalists are defined through their education and specialized skills, that influencers are lacking.
- journalist act in the public interest in a selfless manner, while influencers are working for their own gain.

The way someone defines themselves (journalist or influencer) might thus be less important than the actual work they're doing or the content they're producing. What counts is the public perception.

The implications are interesting. For example, the move by certain journalists away form major publications towards the notion of the [[Indie-Journalism]], mostly in the form of newsletter authors, has the possibility to damage their image as neutral actors and thus their message. Or as Banjac and Hanusch write, the direct commercializing or journalistic work directly undermines its creator.

> Key findings of this study emerge when we examine and compare audiences’ perceptions and expectations of content creators and journalists. A shift towards commercial and market-driven imperatives among both actors leads audiences to disconnect. Among other things, it makes audiences feel like consumers sought out primarily for financial gain. (...) **To combat this perception of content creators, audiences expressed three key expectations: authenticity and transparency, engagement and quality content.**
