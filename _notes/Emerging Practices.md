Itâ€˜s been a long-held belief of mine, that journalism doesnâ€˜t have to mean media in the traditional sense. Everyone with access to publishing tools can act like a journalist â€” i.e. reporting and contextualizing observations and data â€” but not everyone feels beholden to ethical guidelines, the journalistic ethos of the traditional business model of journalism. Furthermore, the digital present is changing the role of traditional journalists as well. 

More and more we can see hybrid roles emerging, which mix journalism with design, coding, project management or even more exotic skills. Opening up the field of journalism to those experiences might open up a new way of defining the practice itself. Journalism after journalists and journalists after journalism.

Many of the topics touched upon here are going to be highly relevant when it comes to the education and career of journalists as well as their daily work.

### Topics

- [[Influencer-Journalists]]â€”With a big following on social media becoming not only a prerequesite for journalists but also a way to go indie, the line between journalist, creator and influencers are more and more blurred.

- [[Indie-Journalism]]â€”A new set of tools (i.e. Substack, Patreon, etc.) is prompting journalists to move away from traditional publishers to build their own indie-publications.

- [[Climate Reporting]]â€”

- [[The New Newsroom]]â€”With most big publishers shifting their business modell towards subscriptions instead of advertising, we also see a shift in the roles inside newsrooms as well as a re-drawing of internal borders between business and reporting units.
