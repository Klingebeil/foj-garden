Over ten years ago Duncan Clark tried to estimate the annual [carbon footprint of the *The Guardian* print edition](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-living-blog/2010/nov/04/carbon-footprint-newspaper). An impact roughly equivalent to about two short-haul flights per year or just 5-10 miles with a car—depending on the size and paper stock of a given newspaper. 
But there is of course a second, more difficult to gauge impact of a newspaper as Clark himself observes: "On some level, an article claiming that climate change doesn't exist must have a much higher indirect carbon footprint than one which highlights the urgency of the latest science."

The last decade has seen a lot of discussions about how to handle the topic of climate change in the newsroom.
