title: The Publishing Stack
---

At the end of July stories by the *New York Times* and *Washington Posts* suddenly included hardcore porn videos. Unbeknownst to these newsrooms a video hoster called *Vidme* shuttered and a [porn company had bought the domain](https://www.vice.com/en/article/qj8xz3/a-defunct-video-hosting-site-is-flooding-normal-websites-with-hardcore-porn), rerouting it to their trove of porn videos.

This might be a rather crass example of a problem that has plagued the news industry for a couple of years now. The digital infrastructure newsrooms rely on can suddenly shift and disrupt their operations. From minor inconveniences such as a surprise porn video, to more menacing things like disastrous "Pivot to Video", [caused by fraudulent numbers by *Facebook*](https://slate.com/technology/2018/10/facebook-online-video-pivot-metrics-false.html).

When we talk about digital infrastructure, we have to talk about control, about power and how little of both news-organizations possess.

- Infrastructure is all about power â€” who shapes the state of publishing in which ways? Power structures and their consequences
	- The shape of the "publishing stack"
- Infrastructure has become often too complex for publishers to completely understand / journalists are often separated from understanding these forces + they donâ€˜t have a lot of power when it comes to the shaping
	- more: they often naively engage in relationships with plattforms and other forms of infrastructure that might promise short-term wins, while undermining the long-term health of a business (deals with the devils)
